  <div markdown="1">I first became fascinated with microbes following an inspiring lecture on fecal transplants in mice in 2008, which led me to pursue a PhD in Microbiology and Biotechnology at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. The major research question I’ve been pursuing since has asked how bacteriophages (or phages, for short) target and kill Campylobacter jejuni, a deadly bacterial pathogen that infects humans around the world. 

  Along the way, I have realized just how important the answers to questions like these are to getting us closer to solving one of the most important health hurdles humans have faced to date: that of antimicrobial resistance and multidrug-resistant infections. 

  I’m passionate not only about the idea that phages can be harnessed to treat these infections, but that we are closer than we think to making phage therapy an accessible and promising option for patients.

  I am a Microbiology and Biotechnology PhD student at the University of Alberta studying the interactions between bacteriophage receptor binding proteins and bacterial carbohydrates. 

  While I am a graduate student at the University of Alberta, I currently work in Dr. Christine Szymanski's glycobiology lab at the Complex Carbohydrate Research center at the University of Georgia as an Exchange Scholar.
